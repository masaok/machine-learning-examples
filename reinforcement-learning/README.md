### What is reinforcement learning?

Let's imagine you're playing a video game where you're a character running around, collecting coins and avoiding monsters. When you start playing, you don't really know what to do. But as you play more, you start learning. You learn that when you collect a coin, your score goes up. You also learn that when you touch a monster, you lose a life.

So, you start to develop a strategy. You try to collect as many coins as possible and avoid the monsters. Sometimes you make mistakes and lose a life, but that's okay because you learn from those mistakes and try not to do the same thing again. Over time, you get better and better at the game.

This is a lot like how reinforcement learning works. In reinforcement learning, an agent (like the character in the game) learns to perform actions in an environment (like the game world) to achieve a goal (like getting a high score). The agent doesn't know what to do at first, but it learns by trying different actions and seeing what happens.

When the agent does something good (like collecting a coin), it gets a reward (like points). When it does something bad (like touching a monster), it gets a penalty (like losing a life). The agent's goal is to learn a policy, which is a strategy for choosing actions that will get the most reward over time.

So, reinforcement learning is all about learning from trial and error, and making decisions based on rewards and penalties. It's like playing a game where you're trying to get the highest score!
