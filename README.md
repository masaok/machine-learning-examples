## Quickstart

```
poetry shell               # Start the Poetry virtual environment
poetry env info            # Check the environment
poetry install --no-root   # Install packages without dependencies
```

## Poetry

Poetry automatically creates and activates its own virtual environment when it's needed, so you typically don't need to manually start it.

Get Poetry virtual environment info:

```
poetry env info
```
